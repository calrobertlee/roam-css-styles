# Cal Robert's Roam Themes

- Minimal aestheic with highly refined color palettes
- Removed topbar for more space (shifted to right vertical bar)
- Centered search bar (using a bit of magic found in Azlen's Zenith theme)

UPDATED: Completely rebuilt Nox theme to address almost all element styling

To use, copy the theme into a Roam page titled roam/css
This process can take about 20-30 seconds so please be patient!
